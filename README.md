Inovation Day - Hotwire

* What is Hotwire?
    * Frontend framework for Rails
    * Since the release of Rails 7 (December 2021) became the default frontend for Ruby on Rails App
* Hotwire is the combination of Turbo and Stimulus
* Turbo:
    * Turbo gives you the speed of a single-page web application without having to write any JavaScript
* Stimulus:
    * Modest JS framework for the HTML you already have
    * The framework that is used when some JS is required
* We don’t have Hotwire by default in our backend, but we can use support starts on rails 6 and we’re on rails 6
